## Critical Constraints
- The GitHub default branch is `experiment/moe-pr13-pr14-stack`, not `main`; verify `origin/HEAD` before branching or pushing.
- Compute paths require Apple Silicon/macOS and MLX 0.32.x, while non-compute CLI imports must remain usable without MLX.
- `transformers` stays below 5.13 until mlx-lm supports its tokenizer registration change.
- SSD-streamed Hy3/GLM execution is opt-in; the resident router remains authoritative and selected experts must be present before dispatch.
- The pinned Hy3/GLM community Q4 artifacts omit declared MTP weights; AR and MTP claims require separate pinned artifacts and benchmark lanes.
- Memory planning is fail-closed: reserve resident weights, KV, runtime headroom, persistent slots, and transient slots under one explicit limit.
- A slot cannot be overwritten until its generation's last Metal consumer is complete; preserve pins, generations, and completion-fence ownership.
- Performance changes require deterministic parity, matched repeated evidence against the immediate predecessor, exact commands, and resource counters.
- Expert-pipeline attribution is telemetry-only on slot-backed layouts; its local lock is never held across runtime work, telemetry-off enters no ledger instrumentation, and the uninstrumented `metal-mmap` path reports it unavailable.
- Records, reader tasks, logical ranges, Python/native calls, and device operations are distinct identities; physical device QD, GPU expert-wait, and GPU idle time remain unavailable.
- Decode primary fractions use covered `decode_observation_ns`; the potentially blocking next-miss step is an upper bound because its readiness scan is non-atomic and its end hook can wait for the ledger lock. Exact generation-thread expert-input blocked time remains unavailable, orthogonal overlaps remain independent evidence, and neither form is itself a bottleneck claim.
- Bottleneck attribution requires same-clock throughput plus occupancy evidence and matched telemetry-off reproduction; no fixed worker target or state percentage is causal.
- Raw benchmark output belongs only under ignored `benchmarks/raw/<benchmark>/<run-id>/`; commit curated summaries with full provenance.
- Auxiliary worktrees are flat direct children of the workspace-level `.worktrees/` directory and must not be created inside the clone.
- Do not silently fall back for unsupported models, layouts, quantization, missing artifacts, integrity failures, or memory-plan breaches.
- Treat cache policy, prefetch, MTP, lower precision, and continuous batching as separate claims with independent gates.
