"""Install the vendored ``ArraysCache`` advance() leak fix into mlx-lm.

Stock mlx-lm 0.31.x ``ArraysCache.advance()`` decrements its metadata with
lazy mx.array arithmetic, leaking one dead graph node (and its live Metal
buffer object) per layer per decode token until the process dies at
Metal's buffer-count limit. The fix (mlx-lm PR #1642 @ 985af30) is
vendored in :mod:`mtplx.vendored_arrays_cache`; this module decides at
runtime whether it is needed, following the ``install_hy_v3_model_shim``
precedent: prefer upstream when it already has the capability, otherwise
install the vendored implementation, idempotently.

Call :func:`install_arrays_cache_fix` before any code constructs GDN /
linear-attention caches — in particular before the mtp_batch launcher
gate (``a3b_mtp_batch._require_mlx_lm_arrays_cache_fix``), which probes a
fresh ``ArraysCache(1)`` for the fix's ``_lp_advance``/``_len_advance``
bookkeeping attributes and aborts startup when they are missing.
