"""SSD cold tier: the reconciliation walk is maintenance, never hot-path work.

Receipt that motivated this contract (2026-08-15, M5 Max, 816,220-file bank):
one ``os.walk`` + ``stat`` of the store took 41.7 s. The previous code walked
synchronously on every write's cap gate and re-walked in the background
whenever ``stats()`` (``/health``, and the lookup-miss path) found the 30 s
TTL expired, so an idle daemon burned most of a core forever once the bank
was large. The contract pinned here:

- the cap gate prices orphans from the last snapshot's delta; it never walks;
- ``stats()`` schedules a rescan only for a *changed* store, and only after
  ``max(TTL, DUTY_DIVISOR x last walk duration)``;
- the walk runs without ``_base_lock`` and installs a torn view as stale;
- a lookup miss reads ``last_miss_reason`` without touching ``stats()``.
