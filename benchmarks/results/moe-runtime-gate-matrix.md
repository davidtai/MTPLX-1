# MoE Runtime Candidate Gate Matrix

Date: 2026-07-12
Clean integration base: `origin/codex/moe-ssd-hy3-glm52@4146f72`
Passed-only integration branch: `codex/moe-runtime-gated-integration`

## Gate contract

The sequential salvage contract in
`docs/specs/2026-07-11-moe-runtime-pr-salvage-design.md` supersedes the old 5%
minimum. A throughput candidate may be retained when repeated matched evidence
is positive in mean and median, the direction is not systematically reversed,
and correctness, deterministic token parity, memory planning, and resource
counters pass. Raw results, the exact command/profile, and the immediate
predecessor are required. Correctness/lifecycle changes use their
contract-specific safety gate. PR #17's explicit budget requires pooled mean,
pooled median, and both arm-order strata to retain at least 95% of base, rolling
p95 to remain within 110%, and peak MLX memory to remain within 1 GiB.

## Status

Sequential salvage in progress: **4 retained (#13, repaired #15, repaired #17,
and repaired #14), 1 repaired but rejected on measurement (#12), 1 repaired
candidate whose performance gate is blocked by an unsafe retained base (#18),
1 repaired through the software gate whose hardware gate is blocked by the same
base failure (#16), and 1 pending repair/re-gate (#11)**. Pending rows
preserve the prior clean-candidate failure evidence until their sequential
repair task is complete.

| PR | Source | Purpose | Correctness evidence | Measured result | Gate status | Integration status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #11 | `fb6f4a4` -> `3d7c158` | Prompt-wide expert hotset seeding | Fresh: 50 focused passed; full suite 1,980 passed, 4 skipped; lint/format/diff checks pass. Semantic probes show a newly dominant expert in the final chunk stays transient when the stale seed is a hit/pinned, leaving the wrong decode hotset; aborted prefills also leak seed counts into the next request. Global scope additionally rejects a realistic chunk with more unique experts than transient slots before wave partitioning. | No GPU run because the correctness contract failed first | **Failed: does not reliably realize the prompt-wide hotset** | Not integrated; candidate preserved on `eval/gated-pr11` |
| #12 | `a8ef882` -> `e65e8f8` + repairs through `124f4ce` | Q8 KV physical-memory accounting | Exact rounding/margin, 80-cache Q8 attestation, single-live-cache admission, process env lifetime, close races, and raw `ar_batch` bypass repaired; full suite 2,033 passed / 4 skipped; spec and quality reviews approved. | Token-identical short lane: 4.7052 -> 0.9896 tok/s (**-78.97%**); read bytes -27.03%, but peak MLX +20.97 GB with only 376.9 MB cap headroom. Instrumented: 4.7846 -> 0.7272 tok/s, SSD 6.670 -> 0.913 GiB/s; classified as serialized, not bandwidth-bound. | **Failed performance/resource gate** | **Not integrated; passed-only tip remains `fb4c1d5`** |
| #13 | `1efb308` -> `939fe57` | Overlap resident shared MLP with pending decode miss I/O | Fresh: 43 focused passed; full suite 1,978 passed, 4 skipped; Ruff check/format and diff check pass; spec and quality reviews approved | Repeated fixed lane: 6.0523 -> 6.5033 decode tok/s mean, **+7.45%**; pair gains +6.84% and +8.07%; all tokens identical | **Passed** | **Retained at `939fe57`** |
| #14 | `87ea0b7` -> `a26da2e` + repairs through `cc659f9` | Stream ready misses in physical completion order | Shared cancellation, exact partial admission/rollback, per-part and aggregate ownership, sticky health, generation reconciliation, KV/close linearization, and lifecycle retention repaired. Two sustained pre-final-fix runs exposed cross-thread MLX heap corruption; RED `ccab0a3` and fix `cc659f9` keep split graph evaluation on the generation thread. Full suite: 2,049 passed / 4 skipped; reviews approved. | Six balanced pairs against `c12cfba`: mean 6.2868 -> 6.3648 tok/s (**+1.2399%**); median +1.7011%; base-first +1.9739%, candidate-first +0.5196%; 5/6 positive. Pooled p95 +0.4328%, worst pair +9.5571%; peak MLX -41,824 B; exact token/stop/cache/I/O parity. Hooks: SSD 5.234870 GiB/s mean / 7.094440 p95; memory floor 47.279657 / 58.021482 GB/s; mixed. | **Passed sequential throughput, safety, tail, resource, and parity gates** | **Retained at `cc659f9`** |
| #15 | `7652fa2` -> `a5be248` + repair `e0e93b0` | All-hit decode fast path | RED reproduced the PR #13 tuple/shared-work break, flattened route-wave accounting, and second-wave pin-cleanup gap. GREEN: 40 focused passed; full suite 1,985 passed / 4 skipped; spec and quality reviews approved; Ruff/format/diff checks pass. | Six order-balanced process-isolated pairs: pooled decode mean 6.5446 -> 6.5549 tok/s, **+0.16%**; pooled median **+0.23%**; median pair gain **+0.36%**; 4/6 pairs positive; token/counter identical. Runner hooks: 5.369 GiB/s mean SSD, 6.998 p95, 48.49 GB/s routed-memory floor. | **Passed under salvage override; small and order-sensitive** | **Retained at `fb4c1d5`; `bbe0b0d` and `05f2f13` not inherited** |
| #16 | `99f0c2b` -> `2fe64c1` + repairs through `6e4c593` | Metal-resident expert routing | Tuple/shared-work and disabled-allocation regressions repaired. RED/GREEN coverage now rejects invalid IDs before device lookup, fences speculative Q4 before both lifetimes exit while preserving the primary error, and commits all-hit policy per authoritative route wave so counters and next LRU victims match host routing. Focused: 126 passed. Full: 2,056 passed / 4 skipped; changed-file Ruff/format/diff checks pass. | Not run. An exclusive retained-base512 canary kernel-panicked the host before the PR16 gate started. Pre-compute host validation also weakens the expected gain and must eventually be measured. | **Software gate passed; hardware blocked by unsafe retained base** | Not integrated; repaired branch published at `origin/eval/repaired-pr16@6e4c593` |
| #17 | `43f5c953` + `8a37f2a`, `72470de`, `992070d` | Metal completion fences for slot reuse | Sticky completion errors, transactional slot/policy restore, retryable close, admission races, and split cleanup repaired; 108 focused passed; full suite 2,018 passed / 4 skipped; Ruff/format/stub/diff checks and both reviews approved. | Six balanced pairs against `07d034a`: pooled mean 6.3843 -> 6.1838 tok/s (**-3.1401%**, 96.8599% retained); median -3.2740% (96.7260%); base-first -4.6798% (95.3202%) and candidate-first -1.5659% (98.4341%); all six pairs negative. Rolling p95 +1.2829%; peak MLX +36,448 B; exact token/stop/cache/I/O/plan parity. Hooks: SSD 4.988902 GiB/s mean / 6.630601 p95, memory floor 45.055829 GB/s mean / 54.971803 p95, classification mixed. | **Passed explicit <=5% lifecycle-safety budget; measured safety cost, not speedup; base-first margin narrow** | **Retained at `992070d`** |
| #18 | `f37be96` -> `883bda2` + repairs through `b5d2262` | Gate/up compute overlapped with down-projection reads | Lifecycle repair passed four RED regressions; cross-row prefix ordering RED `b42a0f7` and fix `b5d2262` prevent sibling prefix writes after the first prefix kernel starts. The focused files pass 108 tests and the full suite passes 2,061 / 4 skipped. | Exclusive base256/candidate256 completed with exact token/byte parity and zero failures; candidate decode was 6.5449 -> 5.6777 tok/s (-13.25%) and reads rose 32,886 -> 53,252. Candidate512 also completed at 5.9337 tok/s with 40,819 progressive routes. The following exclusive retained-base512 arm panicked: its 90,318,125,096-byte process and an ordinary Code Helper Metal queue were blocked for 118.026 s in `IOGPUFamily`/`AGXG17X`, with no competing MLX process and no memory pressure. | **Blocked: PR18 not required for panic, short performance signal negative, retained base unsafe** | **Held unintegrated; resource-level baseline fix required before any further hardware gate** |

## PR #13 standalone evidence

The earlier `+3.1%` PR #13 result was measured after PR #15 had entered the local
history and did not clear the repository's documented 5% threshold. PR #13 was
therefore rebuilt from `4146f72` without PR #15 and rerun as two matched A/B pairs.

| Metric | Base mean | PR #13 mean | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Decode throughput | 6.0523 tok/s | 6.5033 tok/s | +7.45% |
| Reader-active SSD throughput | 3,577.2 MiB/s | 3,560.9 MiB/s | unchanged workload |
| Wall-effective expert-read rate during decode | 5.233 GiB/s | 5.623 GiB/s | overlap exposes more I/O per wall second |
| Decode hit rate | 87.2721% | 87.2721% | identical |
| Expert bytes read | 1,768,689,893,376 | 1,768,689,893,376 | identical |
| Read operations | 165,678 | 165,678 | identical |
| Peak MLX memory | 89,145,824,176 bytes | 89,145,807,988 bytes | effectively identical |
| Token SHA-256 | `484e182a...4c6ed1c` | `484e182a...4c6ed1c` | identical |
| Short reads / I/O errors / integrity errors | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | pass |

Verified-cold Hy3 sidecar SSD sweep (48 runs; zero resident pages before every
lane, zero cached/non-storage samples, zero warnings):

- `pread` + `F_NOCACHE`: 12.469 GiB/s repeated-median at QD8;
  12.676 GiB/s peak repeated-median at QD64
- buffered `pread`: 12.162 GiB/s repeated-median at QD8;
  12.649 GiB/s peak repeated-median at QD64
- `mmap` + `MADV_WILLNEED`: 10.619 GiB/s repeated-median at QD32
- demand-fault `mmap`: 3.729 GiB/s repeated-median at QD8
- Raw result: `m5max-hy3-ssd-bandwidth-20260711.json`

Runner-hook replay (separate, instrumentation-only branch; excluded from the
promotion timing pairs):

- SSD: 5.313 GiB/s mean, 5.188 GiB/s p50, 6.910 GiB/s p95, 9.216 GiB/s max
- SSD utilization: 42.61% of the configured 12.47 GiB/s ceiling; no idle sample intervals
- Routed-weight unified-memory traffic floor: 47.99 GB/s mean, 59.34 GB/s p95
- The memory figure is an analytic lower bound (`expert_requests × record_bytes`),
  not a physical DRAM counter; the standalone MLX STREAM result above is the
  measured device-memory bandwidth.

## Current validation and PR #19 synthesis

- Current runtime tip `992070d`: 2,022 collected; 2,018 passed and 4 expected
  skips; 108 focused tests, changed-file Ruff check/format, stub scan, and
  `git diff --check` pass.
- Raw auto-merge with `codex/hy3-q4-native-serialized@28af6c5`: no textual
  conflicts, but reproduces duplicate `HotExpertSwitchGLU` import (Ruff F811),
  13 changed Python files needing current formatting, and whitespace in two
  PR #19 benchmark Markdown files.
- Temporary dry-merge resolution: duplicate removed, 13 files formatted, all
  31 changed Python files pass Ruff/format/compile/diff checks; full suite
  **2,032 passed, 4 skipped**.
- PR #19's throughput matrix and dry merge predate repaired PRs #15 and #17 and
  must be refreshed after rebase onto the final runtime tip.
