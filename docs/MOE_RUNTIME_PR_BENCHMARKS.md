# MoE Runtime PR Benchmark Report

Date: 2026-07-12
Remote base: `origin/codex/moe-ssd-hy3-glm52@4146f72`
Current sequential tip: `cc659f93eea2c0f4ed5e5b0eff3aca126e4ecf28`

## Result

The original independent audit retained only PR #13. The approved sequential
salvage is rebuilding and repairing each rejected candidate on the latest
retained tip. Current count: **4 retained (#13, repaired #15, repaired #17, and
repaired #14), 1 repaired but rejected on measurement (#12), and 3 pending
repair/re-gate**.
This report will
become the requested consolidated seven-PR report as each remaining gate
completes; prior failure findings remain below so the repair delta stays
auditable.

"Not run" is a gate result, not an estimated zero. Hardware performance was
intentionally not measured after a candidate failed correctness, because a fast
unsafe implementation is not promotable.

## Gate contract and fixed lane

For this salvage series, the approved design in
`docs/specs/2026-07-11-moe-runtime-pr-salvage-design.md` supersedes the old 5%
minimum. A throughput candidate is retainable when its repeated matched mean
and median are positive, direction is not systematically reversed, deterministic
token parity and the candidate contract pass, and resource counters do not
materially regress. Correctness/lifecycle candidates use a contract-specific
safety gate. For repaired PR #17, the explicit budget required pooled mean,
pooled median, and both arm-order strata to retain at least 95% of base, rolling
p95 to remain within 110%, and peak MLX memory to remain within 1 GiB.

The realistic Hy3 lane used:

- Apple M5 Max, 40-core GPU, 128 GiB unified memory
- pinned `pipenetwork/Hy3-4bit` revision
  `160619d3f96c8470350b6dac0ef033a8381551e3`
- 112 GiB total cap, 78 GiB expert-cache cap, 8 GiB runtime reserve
- 4,096 live KV tokens, 99 persistent records per layer, 32 transient records
- layer-local LRU, component-bank slots, 64 MiB reads, `F_NOCACHE`
- checked-in 313-token engineering prompt, chat template, thinking disabled
- deterministic greedy AR, seed 0, concurrency 1, natural stop within a
  2,048-token ceiling
- window telemetry disabled for the headline timing lane

PR #12 used a contract-specific 128K lane instead: the expert-cache cap was
omitted, both arms physically used the same 131,200-token Q8 cache, and only the
planner changed from conservative BF16 accounting/75 slots to attested Q8
accounting/100 slots. Its fail-fast short lane used a fixed 256-token decode
ceiling after the 2,048-token candidate remained active for 19 minutes without
finishing.

Before every salvage hardware run, the fixed streamed/probe process check was
empty. The Qwen model launch agent was disabled and unloaded for the complete
hardware lane; its gateway remained loaded.

## PR #13: shared-MLP / miss-I/O overlap

PR #13 was rebuilt without PR #15 and measured as two matched, process-isolated
A/B pairs.

| Pair | Base decode tok/s | PR #13 decode tok/s | Gain | Base end-to-end tok/s | PR #13 end-to-end tok/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 6.0770 | 6.4924 | +6.84% | 5.7873 | 6.1638 |
| 2 | 6.0276 | 6.5142 | +8.07% | 5.7411 | 6.1759 |
| Mean | **6.0523** | **6.5033** | **+7.45%** | **5.7642** | **6.1699** |

The workload remained identical across all four runs:

- 1,905 completion tokens, natural `stop`
- token SHA-256 `484e182a68604821f69d56d0b15488d26723e6123f6a57f8158f8b20a4c6ed1c`
- decode hit rate 87.2721%
- 1,768,689,893,376 total expert bytes and 165,678 read operations
- zero short reads, I/O errors, or integrity errors
- peak MLX memory: 89,145,824,176 bytes base and 89,145,807,988 bytes candidate

The earlier PR #13 measurement on the PR #15-contaminated local history was
about +3.1%. It was not used for promotion. The clean standalone rerun above is
the retained evidence.

## PR #15: all-hit fast path

The reviewed source `7652fa2` was transplanted as `a5be248`; contaminated merge
`bbe0b0d` and follow-up `05f2f13` were not inherited. RED tests reproduced that
the raw source returned a bare MLX array from PR #13's tuple-returning `_run`,
collapsed policy route waves, and could skip the injected second-wave Q4 error.
Repair `e0e93b0` keeps the probe inside authoritative route waves, preserves
epochs/counters/shared-work ordering, releases each wave's pins on error, and
skips reorder operations only for one complete ordered output.

Validation:

- focused PR #15 suites: **40 passed**;
- full suite: **1,985 passed, 4 skipped**;
- Ruff check, Ruff format check, and `git diff --check`: pass;
- independent spec and code-quality reviews: approve.

The historical `+0.78%` effect was too small for a one-pair decision. The
repaired stack therefore ran six process-isolated pairs with balanced arm order:

| Pair | Order | Base decode tok/s | Repaired #15 decode tok/s | Gain |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | base -> candidate | 6.5486 | 6.4844 | -0.98% |
| 2 | base -> candidate | 6.5629 | 6.5867 | +0.36% |
| 3 | base -> candidate | 6.5828 | 6.5467 | -0.55% |
| 4 | candidate -> base | 6.5251 | 6.5490 | +0.37% |
| 5 | candidate -> base | 6.5349 | 6.5651 | +0.46% |
| 6 | candidate -> base | 6.5131 | 6.5976 | +1.30% |
| Pooled mean | balanced | **6.5446** | **6.5549** | **+0.16%** |
| Pooled median | balanced | **6.5417** | **6.5570** | **+0.23%** |

The median pair gain is `+0.36%`; four of six pairs are positive. The arm-order
strata are visibly different (`-0.39%` base-first versus `+0.71%`
candidate-first), so the result must be described as small and order-sensitive,
not as a precise universal speedup. Balancing the two strata yields a positive
`+0.16%` treatment estimate, consistent in direction with the historical
measurement and sufficient under the explicitly approved salvage override.

All 12 headline arms produced 1,905 tokens, natural `stop`, and token SHA-256
`484e182a68604821f69d56d0b15488d26723e6123f6a57f8158f8b20a4c6ed1c`.
Cache counters, slot metrics, expert bytes, read operations, and MLX memory were
machine-compared and identical. Every run ended with zero pins and zero short
reads, I/O errors, or integrity errors.

The separate runner-hook replay (excluded from headline timing) measured:

- SSD: 5.369 GiB/s mean, 5.239 p50, 6.998 p95, 9.112 max;
- 928,933,768 physical expert bytes per decode token and 43.06% of the measured
  12.469 GiB/s SSD ceiling;
- routed-weight memory-traffic floor: 48.49 GB/s mean, 59.78 GB/s p95;
- 80.44 evictions per decode token; classification: `mixed: no single resource dominates`;
- peak MLX memory: 89,145,807,988 bytes; final pins: 0.

## PR #12: Q8 KV accounting

The original source `a8ef882` was transplanted as `e65e8f8`. The repair series
ended at `124f4ce` and made the memory contract fail closed: it charges the
128-token margin and 16-token block rounding, rejects TurboQuant precedence,
attests all 80 Q8 caches, serializes full-capacity Q8 admissions, scopes the
process-wide KV environment through load/compute/close, protects temporary env
overrides, and keeps Q8 expert streaming out of the raw-model `ar_batch` lane.

Validation of the repaired range:

- final full suite: **2,033 passed, 4 skipped**;
- focused Q8, lifecycle, concurrency, server, and runner suites: pass;
- Ruff, range-format, and `git diff --check`: pass;
- independent spec and code-quality reviews: approve.

The special 128K lane deliberately used the same physical cache in both arms so
Q8 numerics could not confound the planning change:

| Metric | Conservative base `1d3d52f` | Repaired candidate `124f4ce` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Planner KV charge | 42,949,672,960 B (BF16) | 21,831,680,000 B (Q8) |
| Persistent slots/layer | 75 | 100 |
| Measured physical KV | 80 Q8 entries, 8,200 x 16-token blocks, 21,831,680,000 B | same; attestation planned=realized |
| Peak MLX | 90,324,091,556 B | 111,292,219,996 B |
| Headroom below runtime cap | 21.35 GB | **376,929,700 B** |

The natural-stop 2,048-token base completed at 4.5960 decode tok/s. The matching
candidate was still active after 19 minutes and was terminated without a result.
The fail-fast gate therefore used the same prompt/config/cache with a fixed
256-token decode ceiling:

| Metric | Base | Repaired #12 | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Decode throughput | 4.7052 tok/s | 0.9896 tok/s | **-78.97%** |
| Decode elapsed | 54.41 s | 258.69 s | +375.5% |
| Rolling p95 latency | 225.5 ms/token | 1,018.2 ms/token | **+351.5%** |
| Expert misses | 230,681 | 218,025 | -5.49% |
| Expert/read bytes | 497,080,074,240 | 362,713,448,448 | -27.03% |
| Read operations | 45,750 | 33,094 | -27.66% |
| Evictions | 33,302 | 20,725 | -37.77% |

Both arms produced exactly 256 tokens, finish `length`, and token SHA-256
`7aec884257673ffb673a09b8982470dc5cf79c2341e553ea1dc485c97594c6f8`.
Expert requests and route calls were identical; pins, short reads, I/O errors,
integrity errors, deadline errors, and cancellations were zero.

The matched runner-hook replay excluded from headline timing confirmed both the
physical layout and the resource diagnosis:

| Hook | Base | Repaired #12 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Decode throughput | 4.7846 tok/s | 0.7272 tok/s |
| SSD mean / p95 | 6.670 / 8.751 GiB/s | 0.913 / 1.593 GiB/s |
| SSD bytes/decode token | 1,941,719,040 | 1,416,849,408 |
| Routed-memory floor mean | 54.85 GB/s | 10.33 GB/s |
| Evictions/decode token | 130.09 | 80.96 |
| Classification | mixed | **serialization: route/read/compute critical path** |

The candidate reduces storage traffic, but neither SSD nor memory bandwidth is
saturated during its slowdown. Reinvesting every Q8 byte into 25 additional
resident expert slots consumes another 20.97 GB and leaves effectively no MLX
headroom. The premise for this optimization is therefore disproven on the
measured host. A host-specific slot-tuning policy is out of scope because the
existing conservative plan is already safe and substantially faster.

## PR #17: completion fences

The reviewed completion-fence source was transplanted as `43f5c953`. Repairs
`8a37f2a`, `72470de`, and `992070d` make asynchronous completion errors sticky,
recheck them at every admission/reuse boundary, restore prepared slots and
cache policy transactionally, keep split-route cleanup bounded, and make
timed-out close operations retryable. The final repair also closes the last
layer/global admission and partial-submit races without changing Task 4's
separate sibling-read cancellation contract.

Validation at exact candidate `992070df685020b33c46531f3b87ecbea19ce3bd`:

- focused lifecycle/runtime suites: **108 passed**;
- full suite: **2,018 passed, 4 skipped**;
- Ruff check, Ruff format check, stub scan, and `git diff --check`: pass;
- independent code-quality and final red-team reviews: approve.

Because PR #17 is a lifecycle-safety change, its predeclared hardware gate
allows at most a 5% decode-throughput cost in the pooled mean, pooled median,
and each balanced arm-order stratum. It still requires exact deterministic
workload parity, rolling p95 no more than 10% above base, peak MLX no more than
1 GiB above base, exercised fences, and zero fence fallback or failure. Six
process-isolated pairs compared base `07d034a` with candidate `992070d` under
`MTPLX_EXPERT_SLOT_FENCES=1` in both arms:

| Pair | Order | Base decode tok/s | Repaired #17 decode tok/s | Delta |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | base -> candidate | 6.4986995875 | 6.0922996217 | -6.2536% |
| 2 | candidate -> base | 6.2916076748 | 6.2412220452 | -0.8008% |
| 3 | base -> candidate | 6.4724413054 | 6.1998123159 | -4.2122% |
| 4 | candidate -> base | 6.3911989654 | 6.2572961903 | -2.0951% |
| 5 | base -> candidate | 6.3932264116 | 6.1660469818 | -3.5534% |
| 6 | candidate -> base | 6.2583481241 | 6.1460302936 | -1.7947% |
| Pooled mean | balanced | **6.3842536781** | **6.1837845748** | **-3.1401%** |
| Pooled median | balanced | **6.3922126885** | **6.1829296489** | **-3.2740%** |

The mean and median retain 96.8599% and 96.7260% of base, respectively. The
base-first stratum retains **95.3202%** (-4.6798%) and the candidate-first
stratum retains **98.4341%** (-1.5659%). All six individual pairs are negative,
so this is a measured safety cost, not a speedup. The base-first result clears
the 95% floor by only 0.3202 percentage points; that narrow margin is part of
the decision and should not be generalized beyond this fixed lane.

The pooled rolling p95 was 180.78896 ms/token base and 183.10833 ms/token
candidate, a 1.2829% increase. Peak MLX memory was 89,145,807,988 bytes base
and 89,145,844,436 bytes candidate, a 36,448-byte increase. Every arm produced
1,905 tokens, natural `stop`, and token SHA-256
`484e182a68604821f69d56d0b15488d26723e6123f6a57f8158f8b20a4c6ed1c`.
Cache counters, 1,768,689,893,376 expert bytes, 165,678 reads, memory-plan
fields, and final runtime state were identical. Every candidate arm exercised
176,423 completion fences over 717,256 slots, with 378 pin waits, zero fence
fallbacks/failures, and zero final pins, active routes, loading slots, or
runtime errors.

The separate runner-hook replay (excluded from headline timing) collected 653
intervals and measured:

- SSD: 4.988902 GiB/s mean, 4.885349 p50, 6.630601 p95, 9.304924 max;
- 1,768,689,893,376 bytes read, or 928,933,767.53 bytes per decode token;
- SSD utilization: 40.0104% of the measured 12.469 GiB/s ceiling;
- routed-weight memory-traffic floor: 45.055829 GB/s mean and 54.971803 GB/s
  p95, or 7.3381% of the 614 GB/s published ceiling;
- 80.440126 evictions per decode token; classification: `mixed`;
- authoritative run-summary peak MLX memory: 89,145,844,436 bytes.

The memory-traffic value is an analytic lower bound, not a physical DRAM
counter. Peak MLX above comes from the authoritative run summary rather than
the instrumentation sampler's differently keyed peak field.

Decision: **retain repaired PR #17 at `992070d` under the explicit <=5%
lifecycle-safety budget**. Its benefit is fail-closed slot reuse and lifecycle
behavior; its measured cost is a 3.14% pooled decode slowdown.

## PR #14: ready-miss streaming

The original clean candidate failed before hardware because split futures had
independent cancellation, partial admission could lose victims or pins, and
streamed parts had ambiguous ownership. The sequential repair added shared
cancellation, per-part admission, nonblocking failure cleanup, consumer leases,
atomic health/policy commits, generation reconciliation, guarded KV admission,
and close-safe lifecycle retention.

The first repaired hardware candidate still failed 2/2 sustained runs with
macOS `SIGTRAP` reports identifying `BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBMALLOC: memory
corruption of free block` inside MLX graph evaluation. A test-first final repair
keeps split-route MLX fences on the generation thread instead of evaluating the
same lazy graph on the slot-fence executor. That repair is `cc659f9`; the RED
regression test is `ccab0a3`.

Six process-isolated balanced pairs ran in B->C, C->B, B->C, C->B, B->C,
C->B order. The declared four-pair gate was extended to the six-pair hard cap
because the four-pair mean was +0.44%, median was flat, and pair 4 reversed.

| Metric | Base | Repaired PR #14 | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Decode mean | 6.2868 tok/s | 6.3648 tok/s | **+1.2399%** |
| Decode median | 6.3311 tok/s | 6.4388 tok/s | **+1.7011%** |
| Base-first stratum | 6.22798 tok/s | 6.35092 tok/s | **+1.9739%** |
| Candidate-first stratum | 6.34563 tok/s | 6.37860 tok/s | **+0.5196%** |
| End-to-end mean | - | - | **+1.1084%** |
| Rolling-window pooled p95 | - | - | **+0.4328%**; worst pair +9.5571% |
| Peak MLX mean | 89,145,844,436 B | 89,145,802,612 B | -41,824 B |

Five of six pair deltas were positive: +1.2505%, +1.7400%, +2.5408%,
-3.7294%, +2.1121%, and +3.5429%. Every pair had exact token, stop, cache,
physical-byte, and read-operation parity. Each candidate run exercised 153,158
incremental miss parts across 87,913 routes, with zero fence failures, I/O or
integrity errors, short reads, pins, loading slots, or failed slots.

Decision: **retain repaired PR #14 at `cc659f9`**. The measured gain is modest,
but mean, median, and both order strata are positive after the six-pair hard
cap, while correctness, tail, memory, and exact parity gates pass.

## Correctness-gated candidates

### PR #11: prompt-wide hotset

The final chunk can contain both the old resident and a newly dominant expert.
The old resident is then pinned as a hit, so the new heavy hitter is served
transiently and discarded; the first-decode hotset remains stale. Aborted
prefills also leak counts into the next request, and global scope rejects
realistic chunk cardinality before wave partitioning.

### PR #16: Metal-resident routing

The exact clean candidate fails two PR #13 focused tests even with the feature
disabled. On the enabled path, an exception during the speculative probe can
release the mapping lease before candidate Q4 work is fenced. The shortcut also
bypasses `route_waves`: a four-expert/two-transient probe changed two host route
calls into one and changed the next LRU evictions from `(2->4, 3->5)` to
`(0->4, 1->5)`. Invalid router IDs also reach `mx.take` before host validation.

### PR #18: projection/read pipeline

The initial candidate allowed `active_routes` to reach zero with a projection
generation pinned and could mask a suffix failure with projection cleanup. The
sequential repair at `efe1809` added active projection leases, exactly-once
ownership, combined cancellation/deadline handling across prefix and suffix
waits, per-expert projection futures, explicit gate/up evaluation before a
non-synchronizing release, sticky cleanup errors, and completion fences for the
final down projection. Four RED regressions, 53 focused checks, and the full
2,060-passed / 4-skipped suite passed; all six touched files passed Ruff,
format, and diff checks. The repository-wide Ruff command still reports the
same five unrelated errors on base `7fcc036`.

The verified-sidecar base arm completed naturally with 1,905 tokens and
`stop`: 6.5302 decode tok/s, 5.7408 end-to-end tok/s, 89,145,802,612 bytes peak
MLX, 1,768,689,893,376 expert-read bytes, 165,678 read operations, and zero
completion-fence, short-read, I/O, or integrity failures. During the first
candidate arm the host kernel-panicked and rebooted at 09:16:44. The candidate
wrote no artifact, so token parity, throughput, tail latency, SSD bandwidth,
and routed-memory hooks are unmeasured. A catastrophic host-stability failure
is sufficient to reject the candidate; it was quarantined without a rerun.

## Memory and SSD bandwidth

The bandwidth tools ran separately from the promotion timing pairs.

### Unified memory

The matched 4 GiB MLX STREAM lane measured:

- GPU read: **558.0 GB/s** (91% of the published 614 GB/s peak)
- GPU triad: **322.3 GB/s** (52% of peak)

Raw artifact:
[`m5max-memory-bandwidth-matched-4gib-20260711.json`](../benchmarks/results/m5max-memory-bandwidth-matched-4gib-20260711.json).

### Cold-cache SSD ceiling

The storage sweep read 512 real Hy3 expert records per sample, three repeats,
at queue depths 1, 8, 32, and 64. All 48 samples began with 0 resident pages;
none was classified as cached or non-storage.

| Path | Recommended repeated median | Peak repeated median |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `pread` + `F_NOCACHE` | 12.469 GiB/s at QD8 | 12.676 GiB/s at QD64 |
| buffered `pread` | 12.162 GiB/s at QD8 | 12.649 GiB/s at QD64 |
| `mmap` + `MADV_WILLNEED` | 10.619 GiB/s at QD32 | 10.619 GiB/s at QD32 |
| demand-fault `mmap` | 3.729 GiB/s at QD8 | 3.729 GiB/s at QD8 |

[`m5max-hy3-ssd-bandwidth-20260711.json`](../benchmarks/results/m5max-hy3-ssd-bandwidth-20260711.json).

### Runner-hook workload replay

The instrumentation-only replay was excluded from the promotion timing pairs.
Its runner hooks measured the actual PR #13 workload at 0.5-second intervals:

- SSD: 5.313 GiB/s mean, 5.188 p50, 6.910 p95, 9.216 max
- 928,933,768 SSD bytes per decode token and no idle sample intervals
- routed-weight unified-memory traffic floor: 47.99 GB/s mean, 59.34 GB/s p95
- classification: `mixed: no single resource dominates`

The memory number is an analytic floor from routed expert requests times record
bytes, not a physical DRAM counter. The MLX STREAM result above is the measured
device-memory ceiling.

Raw artifact:
[`hy3-q4-gated-pr13-instrumented-cbank99-r1.json`](../benchmarks/results/hy3-q4-gated-pr13-instrumented-cbank99-r1.json).

The repaired PR #14 runner-hook replay measured:

- SSD: **5.235 GiB/s mean**, 5.094 p50, **7.094 p95**, 9.221 max
- sampled physical reads: 1,766,407,274,496 bytes across 624 intervals
- routed-weight unified-memory traffic floor: **47.28 GB/s mean**, **58.02 GB/s p95**
- utilization floors: 42.0% of measured SSD ceiling and 7.70% of published memory peak
- classification: `mixed: no single resource dominates`

[`hy3-q4-gated-pr14-candidate-instrumented-cbank99-r1.json`](../benchmarks/results/hy3-q4-gated-pr14-candidate-instrumented-cbank99-r1.json).

## Current branch verification

The retained PR #13 tip `939fe57` collected 1,982 tests and completed with
1,978 passed / 4 expected skips. Repaired PR #15 completed with 1,985 passed / 4
expected skips. At repaired PR #17 tip `992070d`, the full suite collected 2,022
tests and completed with **2,018 passed / 4 expected skips**; 108 focused tests,
Ruff check, Ruff format check, the stub scan, and `git diff --check` all pass.
At repaired PR #14 tip `cc659f9`, the suite collected 2,053 tests and completed
with **2,049 passed / 4 expected skips**. The changed-file Ruff check and the
23-test streamed-model file pass, including the cross-thread MLX regression.
The contaminated PR #15 merge/fix commits remain absent from ancestry.

## PR #19 dry merge

The earlier dry merge combined runtime tip `939fe57` with
`codex/hy3-q4-native-serialized@28af6c5` in the isolated
`eval/gated-pr19-drymerge` worktree.

Git merged the three overlapping runtime/test files without textual conflicts,
but the raw auto-merge reproduced the known duplicate
`HotExpertSwitchGLU` import in `tests/test_streamed_models.py` (Ruff F811).
PR #19 also brings 13 Python files that need current Ruff formatting plus
pre-existing whitespace in two benchmark Markdown artifacts.

After temporary dry-merge-only cleanup:

- duplicate import removed
- 13 files mechanically Ruff-formatted
- all 31 changed Python files pass Ruff check and format check
- Python compilation and `git diff --check` pass
- full synthesized suite: **2,032 passed, 4 skipped** in 108.20 seconds

Neither source branch was modified by this synthesis. The dry merge now also
predates repaired PRs #15 and #17. When PR #19 is rebased, apply the
duplicate-import/format cleanup there and refresh its throughput matrix against
the final sequential runtime tip.
