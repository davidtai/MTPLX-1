# MoE Runtime PR Salvage Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers-optimized:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers-optimized:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Repair and sequentially gate the useful work from PRs #15, #12, #17, #14, #18, #16, and #11 on top of retained PR #13, advancing draft PR #20 only with passing candidates.

**Architecture:** The integration branch is a monotonic chain: each source commit is transplanted onto the latest retained tip, repaired with RED-GREEN tests, verified, and compared against that immediately preceding tip. The existing cache planner, bounded route waves, slot/pin ownership, PR #13 shared-MLP overlap, and deterministic Hy3 runner remain authoritative. Benchmark-only instrumentation is applied in a throwaway overlay and never becomes an unreviewed runtime dependency.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, MLX, pytest, Ruff, Git worktrees/cherry-pick, `scripts/benchmark_streamed_generation.py`, macOS launchd, the repository's SSD/memory runner hooks.

**Assumptions:**

- Assumes the pinned Hy3 snapshot and sidecar remain at revision `160619d3f96c8470350b6dac0ef033a8381551e3` — results are not comparable if model bytes change.
- Assumes PR #13 at `939fe57` remains the retained runtime baseline — this plan does not re-evaluate or remove PR #13.
- Assumes Qwen can be stopped with `com.tea.qwen.plist` while `com.tea.qwen-gateway` remains loaded — GPU results are invalid if the Qwen model process is resident.
- Assumes each source SHA names the reviewed candidate — this plan never imports `bbe0b0d`, `05f2f13`, or a precomposed local stack.
- Assumes every later task starts from the latest retained tip — a skipped candidate contributes no production code to later candidates.

## Shared gate commands

Use this exact timing lane for every ordinary Hy3 pair; substitute only `LABEL`, `OUTPUT_JSON`, and candidate-specific flags:

```bash
MODEL_ROOT=/Users/davidtai/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--pipenetwork--Hy3-4bit/snapshots/160619d3f96c8470350b6dac0ef033a8381551e3
MANIFEST="$MODEL_ROOT/expert-manifest-sidecar.json"
uv run python scripts/benchmark_streamed_generation.py \
  "$MODEL_ROOT" "$MANIFEST" \
  --model-key hy3-q4 \
  --memory-limit 112GiB \
  --max-live-kv-tokens 4096 \
  --runtime-reserve 8GiB \

  --f-nocache --slot-layout component-banks --trust-sidecar \
  --output-dir benchmarks/results \
  --run-label "$LABEL" --output-json "$OUTPUT_JSON"
```

Before the first GPU run:

```bash
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)" "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tea.qwen.plist"
! pgrep -f 'mtplx.server.openai.*Qwen3.6'
launchctl list | grep -q 'com.tea.qwen-gateway'
! pgrep -f 'benchmark_streamed_generation|probe_mtp|probe_paged' 
```

For each retained candidate, create one throwaway instrumentation worktree from its final SHA, transplant `74e8091` and `e963654`, and run the same lane with:

```bash
--instrument --sample-interval 0.5 \
--ssd-ceiling-gib-s 12.469 --memory-ceiling-gb-s 614
```

Do not use the instrumented replay for headline timing. Run at least three alternating process-isolated base/candidate pairs for a sub-5% effect. Every pair must have identical completion token IDs, token hash, natural stop condition, cache configuration, and runner version.

### Task 1: Repair and gate PR #15 all-hit decode

**Files:**
- Modify: `mtplx/expert_streaming.py`
- Modify: `mtplx/expert_runtime.py`
- Modify: `mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py`
- Test: `tests/test_expert_streaming.py`
- Test: `tests/test_streamed_models.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** global-cache layouts, mapped experts, or miss-route acceleration; they continue through the PR #13 path.

- [x] **Step 1: Transplant only the reviewed source**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x 7652fa2
```

Resolve the `_run(..., shared_work=...)` conflict by retaining PR #13's tuple-returning method and inserting the source fast-path logic without importing later merge/fix commits.

- [x] **Step 2: Write failing policy and execution tests**

```python
def test_all_hit_probe_matches_normal_wave_policy_and_next_lru_victims():
    normal = LayerExpertSlotBank(
        expert_count=8, persistent_slots=4, transient_slots=2, cache_policy="lru"
    )
    fast = LayerExpertSlotBank(
        expert_count=8, persistent_slots=4, transient_slots=2, cache_policy="lru"
    )
    for expert in (0, 1, 2, 3):
        normal.plan([expert], phase="decode")
        fast.plan([expert], phase="decode")
    for wave in ((2, 3), (0, 1)):
        expected = normal.plan(wave, phase="decode")
        actual = fast.try_plan_all_hits(wave, phase="decode")
        assert actual == expected
    assert fast.plan([4], phase="decode").evictions == normal.plan([4], phase="decode").evictions
    assert fast.plan([5], phase="decode").evictions == normal.plan([5], phase="decode").evictions

def test_failed_all_hit_probe_is_side_effect_free():
    control = LayerExpertSlotBank(
        expert_count=8, persistent_slots=1, transient_slots=1
    )
    probe = LayerExpertSlotBank(
        expert_count=8, persistent_slots=1, transient_slots=1
    )
    control.plan([0], phase="decode")
    probe.plan([0], phase="decode")
    before = probe.snapshot()
    assert probe.try_plan_all_hits([0, 1], phase="decode") is None
    assert probe.snapshot() == before
    assert probe.plan([1], phase="decode") == control.plan([1], phase="decode")
```

Add `test_component_bank_all_hit_decode_preserves_route_waves_counters_and_shared_order` and `test_component_bank_all_hit_decode_releases_pins_on_q4_error` in `tests/test_streamed_models.py`. The warmed three-unique/two-capacity route must still produce two waves/two route calls, all fast Q4 events must precede `shared`, and both success and injected Q4 failure must end with `pins == 0`.

- [x] **Step 3: Prove RED**

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_expert_streaming.py tests/test_streamed_models.py
```

Expected: the raw source collapses the warmed route into one policy epoch/route call and mishandles PR #13's shared-work return contract.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement the repair**

Keep `try_plan_all_hits()` side-effect-free until all unique IDs are resident. Invoke it inside the existing `for wave in runtime.route_waves(...)` loop, never on the flattened route. On a hit wave, run assignment-aligned component-bank Q4 in `wave.positions` order, `mx.eval()` before releasing the route, append output/positions, and continue. On `None`, execute the unchanged PR #13 split path. Do not early-return from `_run`; call `shared_work()` exactly once after routed work when no miss overlap exists. Skip concatenate/argsort/take only when one output already spans `range(total_assignments)`.

- [x] **Step 5: Verify and commit repair**

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_expert_streaming.py tests/test_streamed_models.py
uv run ruff check mtplx/expert_streaming.py mtplx/expert_runtime.py mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py tests/test_expert_streaming.py tests/test_streamed_models.py
uv run ruff format --check mtplx/expert_streaming.py mtplx/expert_runtime.py mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py tests/test_expert_streaming.py tests/test_streamed_models.py
uv run pytest -q
git diff --check
git add mtplx tests
git commit -m 'fix: preserve route semantics in all-hit decode'
```

- [x] **Step 6: Run the matched gate and record the decision**

Run at least three alternating pairs against the pre-#15 tip plus one instrumented candidate replay. Retain only if token/stop parity holds, route counters and expert bytes/operations are invariant, pins end at zero, and both matched median and mean decode tok/s are positive without systematic reversals. Expand the run if the historical `+0.78%` overlaps noise.

### Task 2: Repair and gate PR #12 Q8 KV accounting

**Files:**
- Modify: `mtplx/expert_cli.py`, `mtplx/expert_runtime.py`, `mtplx/expert_streaming_models.py`, `mtplx/runtime.py`
- Modify: `scripts/plan_expert_memory.py`, `scripts/benchmark_streamed_generation.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** TurboQuant memory savings or GLM Q8; both must fail closed rather than receive Hy3 Q8 credit.

- [x] **Step 1: Transplant source and add RED tests**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x a8ef882
```

```python
def test_hy3_q8_128k_plan_charges_rounded_capacity_margin():
    gib = 1024**3
    spec = get_model_spec("hy3-q4")
    plan = plan_expert_memory(spec, total_limit_bytes=112 * gib,
                              context_tokens=131_072, runtime_reserve_bytes=8 * gib,
                              transient_slots=32, paged_kv_quantization="q8")
    assert plan.context_tokens == 131_072
    assert plan.kv_capacity_tokens == 131_200
    assert plan.kv_bytes == 21_831_680_000
    assert plan.kv_bytes - 131_072 * 166_400 == 21_299_200

def test_q8_capacity_rounding_can_fail_the_fixed_footprint():
    gib = 1024**3
    spec = get_model_spec("hy3-q4")
    required = spec.resident_bytes + spec.transient_scratch_bytes + 8 * gib + 21_831_680_000
    assert not plan_expert_memory(spec, total_limit_bytes=required - 1,
                                  context_tokens=131_072, runtime_reserve_bytes=8 * gib,
                                  transient_slots=32, paged_kv_quantization="q8").fits_fixed
```

Add tests that reject truthy `MTPLX_VLLM_METAL_PAGED_TURBOQUANT`, skipped/non-Q8 cache installs, wrong converted-layer counts, and a one-byte memory deficit before manifest or allocator access. Extend the benchmark CLI test so `--paged-kv-quantization q8` reaches both `ExpertStreamingConfig` and serialized results.

- [x] **Step 2: Prove RED and repair**

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_expert_streaming_models.py tests/test_expert_cli_runtime.py tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py tests/test_cache_state.py tests/test_generation_sustained.py tests/test_hy3_streamed_mtp.py tests/test_benchmark_streamed_generation_cli.py
```

Compute `kv_capacity_tokens = 0 if logical == 0 else ceil((logical + 128) / 16) * 16`, charge physical capacity, and serialize the capacity, block size, and margin. Reject TurboQuant precedence. Fail before manifest/model allocation when `fits_fixed` is false. Add `attest_expert_streaming_kv_cache()` and require q8 mode, quantized caches, 80 entries, zero skips, and zero TurboQuant entries after cache construction; persist attestation in runner-visible diagnostics.

- [x] **Step 3: Verify, commit, and gate**

Run focused tests, full pytest, Ruff, and `git diff --check`. Compare a conservative 75-slot BF16-accounted base with repaired attested-Q8/100-slot candidate using the same cap and runner hooks. Require token parity, physical planned/realized byte equality, positive median+mean reduction in expert misses and physical expert bytes/token, and no material throughput/tail-latency/memory regression.

**Result:** correctness and attestation passed at repaired tip `124f4ce`, but the
100-slot candidate failed the measured gate: token-identical decode fell 78.97%,
p95 latency rose 351.5%, and peak MLX rose 20.97 GB. Runner hooks showed lower
SSD traffic but a serialized route/read/compute critical path. PR #12 was not
promoted; the passed-only integration tip remains `fb4c1d5`.

### Task 3: Repair and gate PR #17 completion fences

**Files:**
- Modify: `mtplx/expert_slots.py`, `mtplx/expert_runtime.py`, `mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py`
- Test: `tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py`, `tests/test_streamed_models.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** cancellation of sibling read futures; Task 4 owns that behavior.

- [x] **Step 1: Transplant source and add RED tests**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x d484a94
```

Add controlled-event tests named `test_completion_fence_failure_stops_replacement_already_waiting_on_pin`, `test_completion_fence_failure_is_visible_to_snapshot_and_close`, and `test_runtime_close_timeout_is_retryable_after_route_release`. Assert failed fences never change expert/generation/read bytes, terminal cause remains observable by both snapshot and close, and a timed-out close succeeds after the held route is released.

- [x] **Step 2: Prove RED and repair**

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py -k 'completion_fence or close_timeout'
uv run pytest -q tests/test_streamed_models.py -k 'slot_fence or streamed_decode_evaluates_shared_work or 128k_prefill_preserves'
```

Make the completion error sticky and check it inside `_ensure_route_locked` immediately before reuse after any pin wait. Snapshot and close drain and re-raise without consuming it. Separate closing from finalized-closed state so timeout is retryable. Fence bindings in both hit and miss evaluators while retaining PR #13 shared-before-miss ordering.

- [x] **Step 3: Verify, commit, and gate**

Run full pytest/Ruff/diff checks. Gate with `MTPLX_EXPERT_SLOT_FENCES=1`; require token parity, `completion_fences > 0`, zero fence fallbacks/failures, intact overlap order, and no material throughput/tail/bytes/memory regression.

**Result:** source transplant `43f5c953` plus repairs `8a37f2a`, `72470de`, and
`992070d` passed 108 focused tests and the 2,018-passed / 4-skipped full suite,
with both reviews approved. Six balanced hardware pairs against base `07d034a`
measured a 3.1401% pooled mean decode cost and 3.2740% median cost; the
base-first and candidate-first strata retained 95.3202% and 98.4341% of base.
Rolling p95 increased 1.2829%, peak MLX increased 36,448 bytes, and token,
stop, cache, I/O, and memory-plan parity were exact. Each candidate run
exercised 176,423 fences over 717,256 slots with zero fallback/failure and a
clean final runtime state. Runner hooks classified the workload as mixed: SSD
mean/p95 was 4.988902/6.630601 GiB/s (40.0104% of the measured ceiling) and the
routed-memory floor mean/p95 was 45.055829/54.971803 GB/s. Retain `992070d`
under the explicit <=5% lifecycle-safety budget; this is a measured safety cost,
not a speedup, and the base-first margin is narrow.

### Task 4: Repair and gate PR #14 ready-miss streaming

**Files:**
- Modify: `mtplx/expert_runtime.py`, `mtplx/expert_slots.py`, `mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py`
- Test: `tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py`, `tests/test_streamed_models.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** staged gate/up/down projection loading; Task 5 composes that behavior onto this per-expert future model.

- [x] **Step 1: Transplant source and add RED tests**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x 87ea0b7
```

Add `test_incremental_miss_failure_cancels_running_sibling_without_blocking_primary`, `test_incremental_submit_failure_releases_pinned_hit`, `test_streamed_miss_parts_have_one_owner`, `test_streamed_miss_compute_failure_releases_current_part`, and `test_incremental_part_observes_sticky_completion_failure`. Use events/fake futures, bounded joins, and release counters; never rely on sleep-only timing.

- [x] **Step 2: Prove RED and repair**

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py -k 'split_route or incremental or pending_split or completion_fence'
uv run pytest -q tests/test_streamed_models.py -k 'streamed_decode_evaluates_shared_work or 128k_prefill_preserves or streamed_miss'
```

Give all parts one internal cancellation event composed with caller cancellation/deadline. On failure, signal cancellation first, consume only completed futures, attach cleanup callbacks to running siblings, and preserve the primary error. `PendingSplitRoute` owns and releases every hit/miss route exactly once; model code never releases a part directly. Keep PR #17 sticky checks/fences and PR #13 shared overlap.

- [x] **Step 3: Verify, commit, and gate**

Run full pytest/Ruff/diff checks. Require exercised incremental-route/part counters, token parity, positive mean+median decode gain without systematic reversal, and no material tail latency, bytes/op, SSD, or peak-memory regression.

**Result:** source transplant `a26da2e` plus test-first repairs through `cc659f9`
passed the 2,049-passed / 4-skipped full suite and both final reviews. Two
sustained pre-final-fix runs exposed cross-thread MLX heap corruption; RED
`ccab0a3` and fix `cc659f9` serialize split-route MLX fences on the generation
thread. Six balanced pairs against `c12cfba` measured +1.2399% mean and
+1.7011% median decode throughput; base-first and candidate-first strata were
+1.9739% and +0.5196%, with 5/6 pairs positive. Pooled rolling p95 was +0.4328%
(worst pair +9.5571%), peak MLX was 41,824 bytes lower, and token/stop/cache/I/O
parity was exact. Runner hooks measured SSD mean/p95 5.234870/7.094440 GiB/s
and routed-memory floor mean/p95 47.279657/58.021482 GB/s, classified mixed.
Retain `cc659f9`.

### Task 5: Repair and gate PR #18 projection/read pipelining

**Files:**

- Test: `tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py`, `tests/test_streamed_models.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** unverified/trusted-only sidecars or prefill projection pipelining; the candidate gate uses verified sidecars and bounded full-record prefill.

- [x] **Step 1: Transplant source and add RED tests**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x f37be96
```

Add `test_close_waits_for_projection_pin_after_suffix_failure`, `test_suffix_failure_is_not_masked_by_projection_release_sync_failure`, `test_projection_wait_honors_cancel_and_deadline`, and `test_incremental_projection_parts_preserve_order_and_single_ownership`. Preserve existing logit-parity, sidecar-verification, shared-before-prefix, and 128K-prefill-disabled tests.

- [x] **Step 2: Prove RED and repair**

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py -k 'projection or incremental or completion_fence or close'
uv run pytest -q tests/test_streamed_models.py -k 'projection or slot_fence or streamed_decode_evaluates_shared_work or 128k'
```

Count projection routes as active leases until exactly-once release. Forward combined cancellation/deadline through prefix and suffix waits. Adapt projection readiness to Task 4's per-expert futures rather than restoring one `_miss_future`. After `stage_component_gate_up()`, explicitly `mx.eval(hidden)` and release that projection lease with `synchronize=False`; down consumes the staged tensor. Preserve a suffix exception as primary and record any cleanup error for snapshot/close. Fence final down outputs through Task 3.

- [x] **Step 3: Verify, commit, and gate**

Run full pytest/Ruff/diff checks. Use `--verified-sidecar` for both arms. Require `progressive_loads > 0`, `projection_ready_routes > 0`, token/stop parity, positive mean+median decode gain, bounded peak memory, and no material tail/physical-SSD/co-tenant regression.

**Result:** source transplant `883bda2`, RED regressions `eedb6aa`, and repair
`efe1809` passed the initial software gate. After candidate arm 1 panicked the
host, RED `b42a0f7` exposed sibling prefix writes continuing after a kernel had
started reading another row of the same component resource; `b5d2262` collects
all prefix-ready leases before the first gate/up kernel. The focused files then
passed 108 tests and the full suite passed 2,061 / 4 skipped. Exact-prefix lanes
completed through 1,024 tokens at 6.2355 decode tok/s with zero reported
fence/I/O/integrity/pin failures. The next 2,048-token lane caused a second
watchdog panic: its Metal command-queue thread was blocked for 93.559 seconds in
`IOGPUFamily`/`AGXG17X`, while macOS reported no memory pressure. After the
upgrade to macOS 26.5.2, the candidate completed a 1,280-token canary at 6.2306
decode tok/s and a natural 1,905-token run at 5.3603 decode tok/s with exact
token parity, the same expert-read bytes and peak memory as the pre-update
base, 318,836 reads, and zero reported failures. The immediately following
retained-base arm panicked in the updated driver stack, but another agent was
reportedly experimenting. No second large MLX process was live in the panic
stackshot, so overlap is possible but unproven. The arm is invalid for both
performance comparison and causal attribution; do not call it a base-alone
reproduction. Keep PR #18 open and unattributed. Before another hardware gate,
require an exclusive-GPU preflight and a clean cooldown/reboot, then repeat
bounded base and candidate canaries. The pre-existing persistent hit/miss
same-bank CPU-write/GPU-read overlap remains a separate software-isolation
requirement.

### Task 6: Repair and gate PR #16 Metal-resident routing

**Files:**
- Modify: `mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py`, `mtplx/expert_runtime.py`, `mtplx/expert_slots.py`, `mtplx/expert_streaming.py`
- Test: `tests/test_streamed_models.py`, `tests/test_expert_streaming.py`, `tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** making this experiment the default; disabled behavior must remain identical and enabled results must pass a separate gate.

- [ ] **Step 1: Transplant source and add RED tests**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x 99f0c2b
```

Add `test_disabled_metal_route_requires_no_experimental_runtime_fields`, parameterized `test_experimental_metal_route_rejects_invalid_ids_before_device_work` for `-1` and `expert_count`, `test_experimental_metal_route_preserves_waves_counters_and_lru_victims`, and `test_metal_probe_failure_fences_candidate_before_releasing_lease`. The last test requires `lease-enter -> candidate-launch -> probe-failure -> candidate-fence -> lease-exit`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Prove RED and repair**

```bash
uv run --extra dev --extra server pytest -q tests/test_expert_streaming.py tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py tests/test_streamed_models.py
```

When disabled, never access experimental runtime/spec fields. When enabled, materialize and range-check host IDs before `mx.take` or speculative Q4. Probe and commit inside each existing route wave, preserving per-wave epochs/counters/victims and one shared-work execution. Fence every launched candidate in `finally` before its mapping/route lifetime exits; preserve the primary error and fail closed on fence failure.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify, commit, and gate**

First prove disabled candidate matches the prior tip. Then run at least three alternating pairs with `MTPLX_EXPERIMENTAL_METAL_ROUTE_RESOLUTION=1`. Require token/stop parity, positive median+mean, `all_hits > 0`, zero leaked pins/routes, and no material memory/SSD regression.

### Task 7: Repair and gate PR #11 prompt-wide hotsets

**Files:**
- Modify: `mtplx/expert_streaming.py`, `mtplx/expert_runtime.py`, `mtplx/models/expert_mlx.py`, `mtplx/runtime.py`, `mtplx/generation.py`
- Test: `tests/test_expert_streaming.py`, `tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py`, `tests/test_streamed_models.py`, `tests/test_generation_sustained.py`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** changing the decode admission policy; it only seeds the existing policy from a request-scoped prompt window.

- [ ] **Step 1: Transplant the clean source and add RED tests**

```bash
git cherry-pick -x 3d7c158
```

Add layer/global times LRU/frequency final-wave tests where expert 0 appears three times early and once in the final wave while expert 1 appears five times in that final wave; expert 1 must be persistent for first decode. Add `test_prefill_request_window_clears_state_after_abort` plus success, `PostcommitAbort`, and arbitrary-failure generation cases. Add `test_global_prefill_seed_accepts_chunk_wider_than_route_capacity` with transient capacity 1 and seed `(0, 1)`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Prove RED and repair**

```bash
uv run --extra dev --extra server pytest -q tests/test_expert_streaming.py tests/test_expert_slots_runtime.py tests/test_streamed_models.py tests/test_generation_sustained.py
```

Defer selected hotset candidates to candidate-only final waves so temporary pins are gone before persistent assignment. Add serialized `ExpertStreamingRuntime.prefill_request()` ownership that begins seed state at entry and finalizes it in `finally`; delegate through `MTPLXRuntime` and wrap the whole restore/prefill operation. Add global seed validation that checks type/range without applying per-wave cardinality until after partitioning.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify, commit, and gate**

Run full pytest/Ruff/diff checks. Use a 128K prompt with 2,048-token prefill chunks followed by the deterministic complete-generation lane. Require token/stop parity, expected final resident hotset, cleared state after injected abort, no global-cardinality rejection, repeatable positive first-decode/complete-generation effect, and no material peak-memory or SSD regression.

### Task 8: Final evidence, review, and publication

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/MOE_RUNTIME_PR_BENCHMARKS.md`
- Modify: `benchmarks/results/moe-runtime-gate-matrix.md`
- Add: candidate raw JSON and response Markdown under `benchmarks/results/`

**Security flag:** `none`

**Does NOT cover:** merging PR #20 into its base or closing source PRs; PR #20 remains a draft until separately authorized.

- [ ] **Step 1: Update evidence after every gate**

Record source SHA, repaired tip, focused/full/static commands, all raw artifact paths, token hashes, runner-hook fields, matched statistics, and retain/skip reason. Never record an unrun performance gate as zero.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run final fresh verification**

```bash
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check mtplx tests scripts
uv run ruff format --check mtplx tests scripts
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Expected: pytest exit 0 with only documented skips; Ruff and diff checks exit 0; status contains only intentional evidence/doc changes before the final commit.

- [ ] **Step 3: Restore Qwen and verify both services**

```bash
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tea.qwen.plist"
launchctl list | grep -q 'com.tea.qwen'
launchctl list | grep -q 'com.tea.qwen-gateway'
curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit, push, and update draft PR #20**

```bash
git add docs benchmarks/results
git commit -m 'bench: record repaired MoE runtime gates'
git push origin codex/moe-runtime-gated-integration
gh pr checks 20 --repo davidtai/MTPLX
```

Push only a fully verified retained tip. Keep PR #20 draft and link issue #21 as non-blocking follow-up storage research.
