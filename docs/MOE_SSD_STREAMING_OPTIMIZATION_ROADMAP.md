# SSD-streamed MoE optimization roadmap

This roadmap targets the measured Hy3 and GLM-5.2 affine-Q4 streamed paths on
the 128 GB M5 Max. It keeps Python as the control plane, the router resident,
the expert cache user-bounded, and the model artifacts bit-identical. Each
stage must earn its place with a matched benchmark before the next stage.

## Current baseline

- Hy3 Q4 source shards, realistic 313-token prompt:
  - 8.14 prompt tok/s cold, 9.42 warm.
  - 1.17 decode tok/s cold, 1.36 warm.
  - 83.5 GB peak MLX memory.
- Hy3 Q4 verified sidecar, complete 1,391-token response:
  - 12.62 prompt tok/s.
  - 1.39 decode tok/s; 1.57 best 32-token window.
  - 83.69 GB peak MLX memory.
- GLM-5.2 Q4 verified sidecar, short warm trace:
  - about 0.49 decode tok/s.
  - about 90.4 GB active MLX memory.
- Live Hy3 sidecar sample:
  - 80–88% host CPU idle; Python process about 1.2 cores.
  - 0.74–1.34 GB/s disk throughput.
  - cool package, indicating scheduler/I/O/Metal bubbles rather than thermal
    throttling.
- Hy3 exact affine-Q4, 1,024-token prompt / 64-token decode, direct slots,
  80 GiB expert cache, LRU, trusted previously verified sidecar, and
  `F_NOCACHE`:
  - 61.21 prompt tok/s and 5.13 steady decode tok/s (2.19 tok/s including
    prompt ingestion).
  - 91.996 GB peak MLX memory with no compression or swap growth.
  - 46.67 GB read for 63 instrumented decode steps: 740.8 MB/token at an
    effective 3.74 GB/s during decode.
  - 88.96% decode assignment hit rate.
- A Python grouped-weight experiment changed the same first-256 window from
  1.3225 to 1.3261 tok/s (+0.3%). It was removed because copying slot tensors
  cancels the launch savings.

The direct-slot `F_NOCACHE` path has changed the immediate bottleneck. It now
reaches the measured SSD bandwidth floor during decode: 740.8 MB/token at
3.74 GB/s predicts 5.05 tok/s before compute, matching the observed 5.13
tok/s. The immediate exact-model problem is therefore reducing physical expert
bytes per token, not merely adding I/O queue depth. Small-batch Metal occupancy
and router-to-host synchronization remain predicted later bottlenecks. At long
context, KV/attention bandwidth will eventually replace expert I/O as the
limiting resource.

Local route replay also bounds which research ideas can reach the target at
the current 80 GiB allocation:

- uniform 102-slot-per-layer LRU: 89.29% hits, about 718 MB/token in replay;
- uniform Belady oracle: 93.43% hits, about 441 MB/token, or only about
  8.5 tok/s at the measured 3.74 GB/s;
- 10 tok/s requires at most about 374 MB/token at that bandwidth;
- a simple prompt-trained cross-layer expert-ID predictor reached only 37.35%
  top-8 recall (52.7% top-16, 67.9% top-32);
- pinning every expert in the first four sparse layers made this Hy3 trace
  worse at a fixed global capacity.

Consequently, published predictor and shallow-pinning results are hypotheses,
not portable defaults. Dynamic allocation of the global 80 GiB across layers
must be tested before deeper prefetch work.

## Benchmark contract

Run every optimization in these lanes:

1. **Matched Qwen AR lane**
   - exact 512- and 1,024-token MTPLX prompt builds;
   - 128 output tokens;
   - thinking off, temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20;
   - AR only; MTP is a separate acceleration claim with its own lane (the
     Hy3 layer-80 head is now packaged and opt-in, see
     HY3_SSD_EXPERT_STREAMING.md; the pinned GLM Q4 artifact still omits
     MTP weights);
   - compare with the recorded Qwen3.6 27B AR result (about 24.6 tok/s).
2. **Realistic single-stream lane**
   - the checked-in 313-token engineering prompt;
   - natural EOS with the model-specific 65,536-token default ceiling;
   - complete generated response saved alongside raw telemetry.
3. **Context lane**
   - 4K, 16K, 64K, and at most 256K admitted context;
   - GLM uses the 124 GiB/256K/50-slots-per-layer plan;
   - Hy3 uses the 115 GiB/69,632-token/93-slots-per-layer default plan and a
     separately labeled reduced-expert-cache profile for literal 256K.
4. **Saturation lane**
   - batch/concurrency 1, 2, 4, and 8;
   - report both per-stream latency and aggregate output tok/s.

Record prompt tok/s, decode tok/s, end-to-end tok/s, TTFT, 32-token rolling
decode, expert hit rate by phase, bytes/token, read operations, disk MB/s, CPU
idle, MLX active/peak memory, swap, output hash, finish reason, and all I/O or
integrity errors.

An optimization is retained only if it gives at least 5% on its target lane in
repeated runs, does not materially regress another lane, preserves generated
token parity in deterministic mode, and stays inside the memory plan.

## Stage 1 — saturate the sidecar read path

1. Raise transient/I/O slots from 8 to 32. This adds about 243 MiB for Hy3 and
   486 MiB for GLM while retaining the 93- and 50-slot persistent banks.
2. Raise the positional-read chunk from 8 MiB to 64 MiB so a 10.125 MiB Hy3 or
   20.25 MiB GLM sidecar record is filled by one native request.
3. During prefill, sort missing records by sidecar offset.
4. Coalesce adjacent records with a native scatter positional read into their
   already allocated destination slots. The sidecar records are aligned and
   contiguous, so a high-fanout prompt can become a mostly sequential scan.
5. Benchmark normal cached I/O, read-ahead, and `F_NOCACHE` modes. Keep the mode
   that maximizes sustained reads without duplicating the 80 GB application
   cache in the macOS file cache.

Status: direct-slot `F_NOCACHE`, 32 transient slots, 64 MiB read chunks, and
the trusted-sidecar benchmark tier are implemented. The matched probe improved
steady decode from 2.69 to 5.13 tok/s and prompt ingestion from 45.72 to 61.21
tok/s. Offset-sorted/coalesced prefill remains open, but decode is already at
its measured byte-bandwidth floor.

**Expected next bottleneck:** Metal execution and host synchronization once the
SSD reaches several GB/s. Do not claim a target in advance; use the disk trace
to determine whether the internal SSD or expert execution becomes limiting.

## Stage 2 — stop rereading and rehashing avoidable work

1. Let a cold prefill initialize only empty persistent slots with the most
   frequently selected experts for that layer. Prefill must never evict an
   existing decode-hot expert.
2. Preserve decode-only TinyLFU aging after the initial fill.
3. Add a dynamic per-layer capacity experiment. Lend slots from low-entropy
   layers to high-miss layers while keeping the global byte ceiling exact.
4. Add integrity tiers:
   - `record`: current per-load SHA-256, always safe and the default;
   - `verified-sidecar`: full sidecar SHA-256 at process start plus immutable
     file identity checks, then skip repeated hashes of the same bytes;
   - no unchecked mode in the server path.
5. Persist only frequency metadata, never live MLX slot references, across
   sessions. Prewarm from the profile under the same byte admission gate.

The dynamic-capacity experiment is now the first item in this stage. A uniform
per-layer Belady oracle cannot reach 10 tok/s, while an overfit same-trace
frequency allocation shows large layer skew. The deployable experiment must
train on prior prompts and be evaluated on held-out routes; same-trace oracle
results are only an upper bound.

**Expected next bottleneck:** Q4 compute/dispatch on high-hit decode. Measure
bytes/token after this stage; a cache-policy win must reduce physical reads, not
only improve a logical counter.

## Stage 3 — overlap resident hits with misses

1. Split each route plan into immediately pinnable persistent hits and pending
   misses.
2. Submit miss reads to the existing GIL-free native I/O pool.
3. Execute hit experts on Metal while misses are in flight.
4. Evaluate miss experts when their slots become ready, then scatter both
   result sets back to router order.
5. Replace device-wide synchronization with per-wave completion events. Slot
   reuse remains fenced by the last consumer of that slot.
6. Add cancellation, deadline, generation-number, and exception tests for every
   split-route transition.

Prediction is a cache hint only: the original router remains authoritative and
any missing selected expert is loaded before computation. Report both recall
and byte amplification. In particular, a high recall obtained by prefetching
roughly four times top-k can reduce latency only if the extra reads do not
consume the SSD bandwidth needed by true misses.

**Expected next bottleneck:** small Q4 kernels and the per-layer router-ID host
round trip. This stage should raise SSD and Metal duty cycle without requiring
a driver change.

## Stage 4 — maximize MLX work per dispatch

1. Add an all-hit fixed-shape graph for batch sizes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
2. Pass an indirect expert-to-slot table to a custom MLX/Metal operation so
   selected weights remain in their existing slot buffers. Do not stack or copy
   whole expert records in Python.
3. Fuse gate Q4, up Q4, SwiGLU, down Q4, router weighting, and scatter for the
   selected assignments where MLX/Metal supports it.
4. Keep the Python route/cache policy initially; move only the proven hot data
   path native if profiling still attributes meaningful time to Python.
5. Re-run deterministic token parity after every fusion boundary.

**Expected next bottleneck:** unified-memory bandwidth and attention/KV at long
context. At batch 1, transformer layer dependencies limit available parallel
work even after launch overhead is removed.

## Stage 5 — continuous batching for aggregate throughput

1. Add a streamed-AR batch runner using the already supported `[B, 1, H]`
   decode shape.
2. At each sparse layer, take the union of selected experts across live
   sequences, load each missing record once, and run assignments grouped by
   expert.
3. Separate prefill and decode queues so a large prefill cannot stall active
   decoders or evict their hot experts.
4. Tune batches 1, 2, 4, and 8 against latency SLOs. Report aggregate tok/s and
   per-stream tok/s separately.

This is the most direct way to use more of the M5 Max without pretending that a
single autoregressive sequence contains unlimited parallelism.

Status: the streamed-AR continuous-batch runner is implemented
(`mtplx/streamed_batch.py`) with continuous admission at decode step
boundaries, per-stream KV reservations through `admit_kv_tokens` (fail-closed,
released at stream end), bounded joining prefills next to active decoders, and
one `[B, 1, H]` forward per decode step so each sparse layer routes the
cross-stream expert union through the existing wave/split-route machinery.
Fixture tests pin B=1 byte-identity with `generate_ar`, per-sequence
output/KV isolation, single-load-per-step for a record selected by every
stream, and prefill service that cannot evict decode-hot persistent experts.
`scripts/benchmark_streamed_generation.py --concurrency N` implements the
saturation lane and reports aggregate and per-stream tok/s. Batch size is part
of the run configuration label: `B > 1` outputs legitimately differ from
`B = 1` runs of the same prompt (batched kernels see different shapes), so
results are compared only at equal batch sizes. The measured batch-1/2/4/8
saturation runs on the pinned artifacts are still to be taken; joining-prefill
work is bounded per step boundary but not yet chunked, and the runner is
scoped to the Hy3-style pre-norm decoder layout (fails closed otherwise).

## Stage 6 — long-context KV and attention

1. Validate paged attention for both streamed overlays.
2. Add Q8 KV first, then evaluate Q4 KV only with long-context quality gates.
3. Reinvest saved KV bytes into expert slots or runtime headroom.
4. Tune prompt chunks only after measuring expert rereads. Whole-prefill
   grouping can be better for expert reuse; smaller chunks can be better for
   memory and responsiveness.
5. Cap this project’s benchmark matrix at 256K even though the pinned GLM
   config advertises a 1M architectural context.

**Expected next bottleneck:** attention and KV memory bandwidth. Expert-side
optimizations should no longer be credited for time spent in attention.

## Optional later stages

- Add a native event-driven route/cache scheduler only after profiling proves
  Python control overhead is material once I/O and Metal are overlapped.
- Hy3 MTP now has a separately pinned and validated draft artifact (the
  layer-80 NextN head; enable with `--enable-mtp --mtp-artifacts`, see
  HY3_SSD_EXPERT_STREAMING.md). It remains a separate acceleration claim
  and must not be mixed into the AR comparison lane. Any other speculative
  decoder still requires its own pinned, validated artifact first.
- Evaluate lower-bit experts only as a separate quality/performance artifact;
  never relabel a different quantization as the current affine-Q4 model.
- Keep file-backed Metal buffers experimental until tests show that cold pages
  are prefetched before binding, active resources are released under pressure,
  wired/file-backed memory is accounted against the same user limit, and an
  MLX upgrade regression test catches accidental eager residency. Mapping a
  whole layer and touching one word has already shown resource-granularity
  page-in behavior on this host.

## Stop/go criteria

Stop and fix correctness before performance if any run shows a hash mismatch,
short read, stale slot generation, memory-plan breach, unexplained token drift,
or output truncation presented as a complete answer. Promote an optimization
only with saved raw results, the exact command/profile, and a reproducible
comparison against its immediate predecessor.
