# Qwen3.6 35B A3B B8 MTP concurrency

This is one model-specific implementation of MTPLX's generic
[`mtp_batch` concurrency mode](../concurrency.md). Its B8 width, K1 depth,
131,072-token context, and numerics profiles are properties of this Qwen
backend. They are not global concurrency limits.

## Execution model

One request uses the unchanged solo B1 MTP route. Two through eight compatible
requests are placed in one physical fixed-width cohort. For the `throughput`
profile the server installs two physical widths at construction and seals each
cohort onto the narrowest lane that fits it:

- real width 1: unchanged solo B1 MTP route;
- real width 2-3: the native B3/T2 lane (M6 target verify positions);
- real width 4-8: the B8/T2 lane (M16).

A sealed cohort keeps its width for its lifetime; there is no mid-flight
demotion. `balanced` and `b1-exact` keep their single-route behavior. Empty
rows are padded and remain inactive. The rows execute each model cycle in
lockstep because they share one fixed-shape forward, but every row owns its
own:

- prompt and generated tokens;
- target and MTP KV offsets and contents;
- recurrent GDN state;
- target and draft samplers;
- seeded random-number stream;
- token budget, stop state, cancellation event, and result stream.

Sharing batched allocations does not mean sharing context. Row-specific masks,
offsets, commits, and rewinds keep one request from reading or changing another
request's history.

## Geometry

This backend uses depth-one MTP, also called K1:

- `B1` means one request row. `B3` means three physical request rows. `B8`
  means eight physical request rows.
- The MTP head drafts one token per active row with shape `Bn x T1`, flattened
  to `Mn` for projections and MoE work.
- The target verifies the current target token plus that draft with shape
  `Bn x T2`, flattened to `M2n` (`M6` for B3, `M16` for B8).
- Acceptance, correction sampling, and commit decisions are independent for
  every row.

This is why this implementation appears synchronized while still providing
separate per-request contexts. The native B3 width exists because a 2-3
request cohort on the B8 graph pays five inert rows of dense, GDN, attention,
and sampler work every decode cycle; on the B3 graph those rows do not exist.

### Width identity and drift

Each width is its own compiled graph with its own construction-time numerical
self-check; install fails closed if either width fails. Same-geometry
determinism is the exactness gate: two identical greedy runs through the same
width are token-identical (live receipt 2026-08-09: bank-bypassed 3-wide
cohorts reproduced byte-identical outputs within one daemon and across fresh
daemons, at both ~8k and ~13k prompts, on both widths). Identical inputs
include row order — the seal is FIFO, so identical arrival order gives
identical rows. Across widths (the same request decoded through B3 versus B8)
bounded BF16 geometry drift applies — exactly the documented B1-versus-B8
cross-geometry bound — so token drift between the widths is expected and is
not a defect. The same bounded drift applies between session-bank restore
lineages: entries banked at the same token boundary by different execution
paths restore states within the numeric bound but not always bitwise, so a
rerun that restores from different-lineage entries can flip a near-tie token.
That behavior predates the B3 width and is width-independent. Session-bank identity is width-neutral by
construction: cohort rows commit prompt-boundary state from the unchanged
request-local scalar prefill (shared by both widths and the solo lane) before
any width-specific merge, so entries bank and restore identically across solo,
B3, and B8 execution and the policy fingerprint does not embed the physical
width.

`MTPLX_MTP_BATCH_FORCE_WIDTH` (default off, read once at service construction)
pins cohort sealing to one installed width — e.g. `8` sends 2-3 request
cohorts through the padded B8 graph. It exists for matched A/B measurement; a
forced width that cannot fit a sealed cohort is ignored for that cohort.

## Request capabilities

The route supports streaming and non-streaming text generation, independent
request seeds and sampler settings, greedy device-side token selection,
stochastic sampling, penalties, stopping, and per-row cancellation.

The installed route fails closed. It never changes a concurrent request to AR
or silently falls back to another kernel. This backend requires:

- Qwen3.6-35B-A3B with the expected MTPLX target and MTP weights;
- native MTP generation with depth 1;
- `max_active_requests=8` and `decode_batch_max=8`;
- a 131,072-token context window;
- the `turbo` runtime profile and `target_prefix` verify strategy;
- the stock verify-core selection used by the installed B8 graph;
- `prompt_tokens + max_tokens <= 131072` for every request.

The server binds the measured Qwen packed projections, row-owned router,
combine tail, and B8 GDN geometry once during construction. Users do not need
the private launcher's `MTPLX_*` environment exports. An incomplete contract
fails before model weights load; a numerical self-check failure also prevents
the route from being installed.

The route does not accept `response_format`, vision splice input, background
requests, or a request-level MTP depth other than 1. Invalid server settings
fail before model construction. Invalid request settings return an OpenAI-style
400 error before cohort admission.

## Numerics profiles

Choose one route with
`--mtp-batch-numerics throughput|balanced|b1-exact`. The performance value is
spelled `throughput`; `performance` is not an accepted value.

| Value | Execution | Numerical contract |
|---|---|---|
| `throughput` | Fixed B8/T2 target and B8/T1 draft; default | Fastest aggregate route; bounded BF16 geometry drift from B1 is allowed |
| `balanced` | B8 scheduling with selected layer-zero projections using B1 arithmetic | Closer to B1, but later B8 reductions mean it is not bit- or token-exact with B1 |
| `b1-exact` | Every request uses the unchanged B1 implementation serially | B1 token and cache behavior; it does not claim B8 execution or aggregate B8 throughput |

The device-resident greedy optimization is token-exact with the earlier B8
route. It does not make B8 bit-exact with B1. On the measured legacy greedy
workload, `throughput` reached 349.064 aggregate TPS and `balanced` reached
259.650 TPS. The balanced result missed its 300 TPS promotion floor, so
`throughput` remains the default. See the
[numerics design and receipts](../specs/2026-08-09-qwen35b-mtp-batch-numerics-profiles-design.md)
for the full benchmark and EvalPlus results.

## Start this backend

This lane currently depends on the open
[mlx-lm ArraysCache fix](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/pull/1642).
A normal MTPLX install still resolves released `mlx-lm 0.31.3`, which does not
contain the fix. Until it appears in a release, install the reviewed commit
into the same environment that runs `mtplx`. For a source checkout:

```bash
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python --no-deps \
  "mlx-lm @ git+https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm.git@985af30df768a6f4dd2d0c7969d1868ca5dc3e1a"
.venv/bin/python -c 'from mlx_lm.models.cache import ArraysCache; c=ArraysCache(1); assert hasattr(c, "_lp_advance") and hasattr(c, "_len_advance")'
```

The check prevents a known per-token Metal buffer-object leak during long
Qwen batch decode. The server also runs this check before loading model
weights and prints an install command for its exact Python interpreter if the
fix is missing. `uv sync` and similar dependency resync commands can replace
the fixed checkout with the released package, so repeat the install after a
resync until PR #1642 is released.

Use the full construction contract. Change only the final numerics value when
switching among the three routes:

```bash
mtplx serve \
  --model Youssofal/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed \
  --download \
  --scheduler-mode mtp_batch \
  --batching-preset throughput \
  --generation-mode mtp \
  --load-mtp \
  --depth 1 \
  --max-active-requests 8 \
  --decode-batch-max 8 \
  --context-window 131072 \
  --profile turbo \
  --verify-strategy target_prefix \
  --verify-core stock \
  --mtp-batch-numerics throughput
```

To use another numerics route, replace the last value with `balanced` or
`b1-exact` and restart the server.

### Persistent configuration

The scheduler, width, context, and numerics choice can be saved in the user
config:

```bash
mtplx config set scheduler_mode mtp_batch
mtplx config set batching_preset throughput
mtplx config set max_active_requests 8
mtplx config set decode_batch_max 8
mtplx config set context_window 131072
mtplx config set mtp_batch_numerics throughput
mtplx config show --json
```

Depth, generation mode, MTP loading, and verify core remain explicit launch
arguments:

```bash
mtplx serve \
  --model Youssofal/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed \
  --download \
  --generation-mode mtp \
  --load-mtp \
  --depth 1 \
  --profile turbo \
  --verify-strategy target_prefix \
  --verify-core stock
```

An explicit CLI value overrides the saved value for that launch. To change a
running service, stop it, change the config or launch arguments, and start it
again. If launchd or another service manager owns the process, update that
service's arguments and restart the same service; do not start a second model
process beside it.

## Confirm this route is active

The health payload reports the installed profile and route. After sending at
least two requests concurrently, it also provides behavioral evidence that a
real multi-row cohort ran:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health | jq '.scheduler | {
  mode,
  active_lane,
  numerics: .mtp_batch_numerics,
  route: .mtp_batch_route_id,
  last_real_width: .telemetry.last_real_width,
  batch_histogram: .telemetry.batch_histogram
}'
```

For `throughput` or `balanced`, `last_real_width` must be between 2 and 8 to
prove this backend handled concurrent requests. A configured mode or route ID
alone does not prove that a cohort ran. A single request correctly reports the
solo MTP lane. `b1-exact` reports `mtp_batch_b1_exact_serial` and never claims a
fixed-width B8 execution.

For `throughput`, the scheduler payload also reports
`mtp_batch_installed_widths` (`[3, 8]`) with per-width route IDs in
`mtp_batch_width_routes`, and `telemetry.fixed_width_histogram` counts decode
cycles by the physical width that executed them (`{"3": ...}` proves real B3
cohorts ran). Completion metadata reports the sealed width per request:
`mtp_batch_fixed_width` is 3 for a B3 cohort row, 8 for B8, and
`scheduler_policy` is `fixed_mtp_batch_width_3` or `fixed_mtp_batch_width_8`
accordingly.

## Live serving receipt

These modes were loaded from a clean installed wheel against the real
`Youssofal/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTPLX-Optimized-Speed` model on 2026-08-09. Each
test submitted eight simultaneous OpenAI requests and completed all eight with
eight unique response IDs:

| Mode | Observed route | Physical execution receipt |
|---|---|---|
| `throughput` | `qwen35b_a3b_mtp_batch_b8_t2_m16_throughput` | `last_real_width=8`, `batch_histogram={"8":1}` |
| `balanced` | `qwen35b_a3b_mtp_batch_b8_t2_l0_b1_qkv_z_b_balanced` | `last_real_width=8`, `batch_histogram={"8":1}` |
| `b1-exact` | `qwen35b_mtp_batch_b1_exact_serial` | eight solo runs, no fixed-width B8 execution |

The first two rows prove a real B8 model forward occurred; a selected config
value alone would not. The exact route proves the opposite by design: it keeps
the concurrent request queue but executes each request through the unchanged
B1 runner.
