# Qwen 3.6 quantization eval matrix — HumanEval+/MBPP+ with bf16 references

Measured 2026-07-30/31 on an M5 Max (100 GiB wired limit), MTPLX serving stacks,
one model resident at a time (flock-guarded windows). Full EvalPlus suites —
HumanEval 164 and MBPP 378, greedy (`temperature 0`), `enable_thinking: false` —
via `evalplus.codegen --backend openai` against each live serving config, scored
with `evalplus.evaluate` (base + plus pass@1). Rates are server-reported
(`mtplx_stats`), never client-wall-derived.

## Results

| config | HumanEval / + | MBPP / + | solo tok/s | conc2 agg | prefill tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A3B 35B bf16 (reference) | 91.5 / 88.4 | 89.7 / 75.9 | 62 | 55.1 | 3177 |
| A3B 35B 6-bit "Balance" | 91.5 / 89.0 | 90.5 / 76.5 | 106–115 | 82.5–104 | 3070 |
| A3B 35B 4-bit "Speed" | 91.5 / 87.2 | 91.8 / 77.8 | 111.6–112.0 | 99.7 | 3319 |
| 27B bf16 (reference) | 93.9 / 90.2 | 92.1 / 77.8 | 9.8 | 9.0 | 846 |
| 27B 8-bit "Quality" | 93.3 / 90.9 | 89.9 / 75.7 | 36.8 | 58.2 | 724 |
| 27B 4-bit "Speed" | 92.7 / 90.9 | 90.5 / 76.2 | ~36–50 | 64.7 | 734 |

Models: `Youssofal/Qwen3.6-27B-MTPLX-Optimized-{Speed,Quality}`,
`Youssofal/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTPLX-Optimized-Balance` (6-bit gs64 affine, gate
layers 8-bit), and the official `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B` / `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B`
bf16 releases as references.

## Verdicts

- **A3B 4-bit is the family's first real degradation step — but a trade, not a
  broad loss.** HumanEval+ drops to 87.2 (worst in the A3B family; 6-bit 89.0,
  bf16 88.4) while MBPP+ rises to 77.8 (best in the family) with the matrix's
  highest prefill (3319 tok/s). 6-bit stays the default for HumanEval-shaped
  work; ~3 pt below the community Q4_K_M leaderboard HE+ reference (90.2),
  attributable to quant-recipe difference rather than harness difference.
- **The A3B 6-bit quantization is free.** It scores at or above its own bf16
  reference on all four tiers (differences within 1–2 problems), decodes 1.7×
  faster, and matches bf16 prefill. There is no measured quality reason to
  serve the A3B at more than 6 bits.
- **The 27B quants give up ~2 points of MBPP** against bf16 (92.1 → 89.9/90.5
  base; 77.8 → 75.7/76.2 plus) and 0.6–1.2 of HumanEval base. Both quants
  score *above* bf16 on HumanEval+ (90.9 vs 90.2).
- **4-bit ≈ 8-bit across every tier.** The 8-bit build's quality premium does
  not appear on these suites.
- Highest absolute scores on the box: 27B bf16 on MBPP (92.1/77.8) — at an
  unusable 9.8 tok/s (dense bf16 is memory-bandwidth-bound; ~54 GB weights
  against ~614 GB/s lands almost exactly on the measured rate).
- Prefill is compute-bound, not weight-bound: ~724–850 tok/s for every 27B
  precision; ~3.1–3.2k tok/s for the A3B (MoE, ~3B active params).

## Comparison with published numbers

Community EvalPlus references for the 35B-A3B (Q4_K_M leaderboard submission;
UD-Q6_K_XL) report 93.3/90.2 HumanEval and 90.2/75.4 MBPP — our 6-bit MLX
build lands within 2–3 HumanEval problems and above on MBPP. No official bf16
EvalPlus numbers exist for either model (vendor cards publish agentic
benchmarks only), which is why the references here were measured locally.

## Serving configs measured

- 27B builds: mtplx 2.3.0-src, `--generation-mode mtp --depth 2`,
  `capture_commit` / `linear-gdn-from-conv-tape`, turbo profile, headquarter
  GDN tape kernel, width-2 lockstep cohort (`--scheduler-mode
  mtp_cohort_experimental`, 8-bit lane via the q8 M6 + qmv_wide kernels).
- A3B Balance: `--scheduler-mode ar_batch`, MTP depth 2 solo, turbo profile.
- bf16 references: `--generation-mode ar`, sustained profile (no MTP sidecars
  in the official repos).

Raw receipts (samples, `eval_results.json`, probe logs, chain logs) are
retained and available on request; the table above uses the EvalPlus console
output as canonical (a JSON-recount cross-check differs by at most 0.6 pt,
a counting-method nuance).
